        Written by Caldecott Honor Award-Winning illustrator and author Molly Bang, “Picture This: How Pictures Work” uses the popular children’s fairy tale of “Little Red Riding Hood” as the visual backdrop and illustrative premise behind this ingenious book.  While this book may not give you the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,” it does intelligently answer some pressing questions about how we emotionally perceive shapes, colors and other compositional elements within a scene.  But more importantly, how we perceive them within the context of our own experience.  In many ways, this book helps provide clarity to the often polarizing question of “what is art,” because it speaks directly to how people will emotionally perceive and react to our photographs at the most basic instinctual (and universal) level.

        Using a few easy-to-follow principles demonstrated through the story of “Little Red Riding Hood,” Molly Bang shows us how different arrangements of shapes and colors on a page can be used to help build powerful, emotionally charged visual statements.  In the process, she helps answer questions like, “Why does a triangle make us feel stable, while diagonal lines make us tense?”; “How can the arrangement and size of shapes be used to create a sense of depth?”; “How do certain colors or color combinations change the way we react to an image?”; and ultimately, “How do the compositional choices we make affect how we feel about an image?”

        Molly Bang takes this analysis one step further by delving into the psychological implications and impact of these compositional choices, even going so far as to include the insights of renowned art psychologists.
