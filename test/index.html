    <p>Bridger Bowl is an alpine ski area in the western United States, near Bozeman, Montana. It serves the local population of Gallatin County, including Montana State University. The summit elevation is 8,700 feet above sea level, with a vertical drop of 2,600 feet on east-facing slopes.  <br />
    Located sixteen miles (26 km) north of Bozeman in the Bridger Range of southern Montana, Bridger Bowl is a locally owned non-profit ski area. It provides locals with affordable skiing, great terrain, and outstanding snowfall. The ski area and mountain range are named after the noted mountain man Jim Bridger, and are accessed from state highway 86.<br />
    In addition to the existing base lodge and a mid-mountain lodge, a new main lodge opened in 2005 at the base area.</p><br />

    <h2>Showdown</h2>
<img id="showdown" src="images/showdown.png" height="280x" alt="Show" title="showdown"/>
    <p>Showdown is an alpine ski area located in the Little Belt Mountains in Central Montana, United States. Created in 1936 and originally called King's Hill Ski Area, Showdown is a small-scale ski area that is often closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, receiving most patrons on the weekends during the season.  <br />
Originally created in 1936, Showdown is Montana's oldest operating ski area, as well as one of the oldest in the United States. It was originally called King's Hill Ski Area, and was operated by the Great Falls Ski Club. In 1940, the ski area opened its first Rope Tow, donated by Great Falls businessman Charlie Bovey. In 1957, the ski club along with members from the Great Falls Ski Patrol formed Ski Lift Inc. to manage the operations of the area. The company sold stock, and purchased a Poma lift that traveled up The Hall-o, and ended at the top of the mountain. The company also began adding additions to the lodge, with the last addition to the main lodge completed in 1968. In 1964, the Poma was replaced with a T-bar. The Poma was relocated to the far Northside of the mountain as a learning area lift. In 1970, Ski Lift Inc. purchased the Prospector Chairlift from WSO Stadeli. At the time, it was the longest chairlift ride in the world. Prior to the installation of the chairlift, runs off of the ridge had no exit point except for a rope tow that took skiers from the bottom of Second Thought, up Dicks Ditch, ending at Arkansas Traveler.</p>  <br />
